Installation (Windows only)
---------------------------

Download the project and extract the files. After that, you need a "mirc.exe" file. Go to http://www.mirc.com and download mIRC. Install it and, once installed, copy the mirc.exe file to your mCitadels folder.

Usage
-----

Doubleclick on mIRC.exe (in your mCitadels folder!) and start the program. You will see a window with a warning message telling you that mIRC is shareware and that we should pay some money if we want to use mIRC for more than 30 days. After that time, the program will not stop working, it is left to you the decision to pay for the excelent work done by mIRCÂ´s creator. Press "Continue" and go on.

Several things may happen now. If we have a monitor resolution of less than 1024x768 configured, a window will warn us about that and close the program. If there were no problems with the resolution or if we solved them, a window with 3 sections will be presented: Client, Server and Options.

In Options, "Language option" does not need to be explained -I suppose-. If you are interested in adding a new language support, you only have to find the file called msgs.english.txt in the ciudadelas subfolder, translate it and save it as msgs.yournewlanguage.txt.

In the Client section we have the Host, Port and Name fields as well as the button To play. This is the basic window to play. If a friend has created a game, he must tell us his IP (or host) and the port to connect to, we write our name and click "Play".

If we want to create a game, we will have to go to Server section. Here we configure the port in which we want players to connect and a name for our game. We click "create game" and wait for players to connect. Once enought players have connected, lets click "start game" and... play!. If we want to play with other than the 8 original characters, we must set that option BEFORE clicking "create game"...

Each time a player clicks "Play" (and joins to one), a window called "Chat" is opened to allow him to speak with other players and to wait for the game to start. You can see the other connected users at the top-right margin of the window. Once enough players are connected, the one who created the game should start it with the "Start game" button in the Server section and more windows are opened: Board, Hand and Characters. "Board" and "Hand" windows are opened for all whereas "Characters" will be seen only by the player selecting character at that moment.

In order to move between windows, we only should take a look at the top-left margin of our mCitadels windows and select the button we want.

"Board" window is the one in wich we see the other players, their points, the gold they hold and the number of cards they own at hand, as well as the districts that they have already built. It is in this window where we will see our action buttons when our turn arrives. It is important to know that some action buttons will be not active if we cant do the action at that moment for some reason (for example, "End turn" will not be activated once we have drawn cards until we discard the one we must from our Hand). At Center-right of the window, there is a yellow square in which we can read all the actions that we and the other players are doing. We can use that square to chat without going to the "Chat" window.

"Hand" window shows the non-built districts we own (which our opponents do not know). It is in this same window in which we will choose the cards we discard when we must do it. We usually will only see the cards we own here, nevertheless, if we must carry out some action with the cards (like discarding, or changing using the Mage), an explanatory yellow rectangle will appear explaining the action we should do.

"Characters" window appears when we must choose character to play with, when we have to discard one (in the 2 players games) or when we must choose a character to be affected by our actions (to kill, to rob...).

And thats all!
