118 Announce a character you wish to murder. The player who has the murdered character says nothing, and says nothing when the character is called to take his turn. The murdered character misses his entire turn.
119 Announce a character from whom you wish to steal. When the player who has this character isc alled upon and shows his character card, you take all of his gold. You may not steal from the Assassin or the character that the Assassin murdered.
120 At any time during your turn, you may do one of the following two things: 1) Exchange your entire hand of cards (not the cards in your city) with the hand of another player. This applies even if you have no cards in your hand, in which case you simply take the other player's cards. 2) Discard any number of cards from your hand to the bottom of the District Deck, then draw an equal number of cards from the top of the District Deck.
121 You receive one gold for each noble (yellow) district in your city. When the King is called, you immediately receive the crown counter and will be the first player to choose your character during the next round.
122 You receive one gold for each religious (blue) district in your city. Your districts may not be destroyed by the Warlord.
123 You receive one gold for each trade (green) district in your city. After you take an action, you receive one extra gold. Therefore, you can either receive three gold, or draw a card and receive one gold.
124 After you take an action, you draw two extra district cards and put both in your hand. You may build up to three districts during your turn.
125 You receive one gold for each military (red) district in your city. At the end of your turn, you may destroy one district of your choice by paying a number of gold equal to one less than the cost of the district. Thus, you may destroy a cost 1 district for free, a cost 2 district for 1 gold, or a cost 5 district for 4 gold. You may destroy one of your own districts. You may not, however, destroy a district in a city that is already completed by having eight districts.
126 For purposes of victory points, the Haunted City is considered to be of the color of your choice. You cannot use this ability if you built it during the last round of the game.
127 The Keep cannot be destroyed by the Warlord.
128 The Imperial Treasury costs 4 gold to build, but gives you one point for each gold you own at the end of the game.
129 You can build the same building card you already have in your city. If the Quarry is destroyed, you will not lost these built districts.
130 If you choose to draw cards when you take an action, you keep both of the cards you have drawn.
131 The cost for the Warlord to destroy any of your other districts is increased by one gold.
132 For purposes of income, the School is considered to be of the color of your choice.
133 This district costs 6 gold to build, but is worth 8 points at the end of the game.
134 When the Warlord destroys a district, you may pay one gold to take the destroyed district into your hand. You may not do this if you are the Warlord.
135 Once during your turn, you may pay two gold to draw three district cards.
136 If you choose to draw cards when you take an action, you draw three cards, keep one of your choice, and put the other two on the bottom of the deck.
137 Once during your turn, you may discard a district card from your hand and receive one gold from the bank.
138 The Wish Fountain gives you one bonus point at the end of the game for each other purple district in your city.
139 This district costs 6 gold to build, but is worth 8 points at the end of the game.
140 Witch
141 After you take an action, you announce which character you wish to bewitch, then immediately end your turn. When the player who has the bewitched character is called upon, he shows his character card and takes an action, then immediately ends his turn. You now resume this player's turn as if you were playing the bewitched character, using all that character's powers (including the one gold bonus of the Merchant or the two card bonus of the Architect) in your city. If the King is bewitched, the King player still receives the crown counter. If no one has the bewitched character, you do not resume your turn. The Thief cannot steal from the Witch or the character that the Witch bewitched.
142 Tax Collector
143 If a player builds one or more districts in his city, that player must, at the end of his turn, give you one gold (if he has any gold left). If the Assassin or Witch has already built a district card, and has any money left, that player must also pay you a gold as soon as you reveal that you have the Tax Collector.
144 Wizard
145 You may look at another player's hand of cards and take one card. You may then either put this card into your hand, or pay to build it into your city. If you build it into your city, it does not count as your one district this turn, which means you can build another district as well. You may build a district identical to a district already in your city.
146 Emperor
147 You receive one gold for each noble (yellow) district in your city. When the Emperor is called, you immediately take the crown counter from the player who has it and give it to a different player (but not yourself). The player who receives the crown counter must give you one gold or one district card from his hand. If the player has neither a gold nor a card, he does not have to give you anything. (Note that, like the King, the Emperor may not be in the face-up discarded character cards.)
148 Abbot
149 You receive one gold for each religious (blue) district in your city. The player who has the most gold must pay you one gold. If there is a tie for the player with the most gold, or if you have the most gold, then no one pays you.
150 Alchemist
151 You get back all the gold you spend to build district cards, but not the gold you spend for other reasons (paying the Tax Collector, for example). You cannot spend more gold than you have during your turn.
152 Navigator
153 After taking an action, you receive four gold or draw four cards. You may not build any district cards.
154 Diplomat
155 You receive one gold for each military (red) district in your city. At the end of your turn, you may take a district from another player's city in exchange for a district in your city. If the district you take has a higher cost than the district you give, you must pay the difference in gold to the player with whom you make the exchange. (The Great Wall affects this cost.) You may not take the Keep district, or any districts in the Bishop's city. Note: If you are using the Diplomat in your game, you must remove the Cemetery from the deck, as it will not be used.
156 Queen
157 You receive three gold if you are sitting beside the King. If the King has been murdered, but was sitting beside you, you receive three gold when this becomes known (that is, immediately after your turn).
158 Artist
159 You may "beautify" one or two of your districts by putting your gold on one or both of them. The cost of a beautified district (and therefore the cost of destroying or exchanging it) is increased by one. Note that this increases how many points you receive for the district at the end of the game. There can be only one gold on any one district.
